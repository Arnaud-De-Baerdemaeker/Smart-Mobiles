# Smart Mobiles


This website allows the user to get detailed informations on many mobile devices (phones, tablets and watches).

It was built using ReactJS, SCSS and uses the [Phone Specs API](https://github.com/azharimm/phone-specs-api) made by [Azhari Muhammad M](https://www.azharimm.dev/).

The users are able to :
\- consult a list of the latest phones added to the database
\- research all phones from a brand
\- research phones by entering a term
\- consult the specifications of a device by clicking on the card
\- see all the photos of a phone in a gallery by clicking on the thumbnail
\- see a fullscreen photo of the device by clicking on the thumbnail in the gallery

Credits to Azhari Muhammad M for making and providing the API.
